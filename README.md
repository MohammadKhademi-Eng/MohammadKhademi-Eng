# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Khademi

I am a **Dual Master’s Engineer** specializing in the intersection of **Industrial Systems Optimization**, **Digital Twins**, and **Meta-Heuristic Algorithms**. Currently based in Genoa, Italy, my research and professional interests focus on Industry 5.0—bridging the gap between theoretical models and stochastic industrial realities.

---

### 🔧 What I Do
I build **Maintenance-Aware Digital Twins (MADO)** and custom **Genetic Algorithms** to solve complex operational challenges. My work focuses on:
* **Resilience:** Creating production policies that remain stable under structural parameter drift (aging equipment).
* **Sustainability:** Using multi-objective optimization to balance profit with energy efficiency and CO2 reduction.
* **Economic Value:** Maximizing NPV in mining operations through intelligent stockpile management logic.

### 🚀 Core Expertise
* **Simulation Engineering:** Advanced AnyLogic modeling (Discrete-Event & Agent-Based) with custom Java logic injection.
* **Optimization Science:** Meta-heuristics (Genetic Algorithms, Scatter Search), OptQuest, and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM).
* **Data Analytics:** Monte Carlo verification, statistical hypothesis testing (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis), and sensitivity analysis.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Industrial Safety Engineering, Logistics, and Mining Production Optimization.

### 🎓 Academic Background
* **M.Sc. in Safety Engineering for Transport, Logistics, and Production** | University of Genoa, Italy.
* **M.Sc. in Mining Engineering** | University of Kashan.
